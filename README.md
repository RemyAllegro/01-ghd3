Assignment 1 - Remy Allegro
===

For this assignment, I used the [code snippet from Lecture 1](https://wpi0-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ltharrison_wpi_edu/ETunJKUEx61ArpK7LGjA-PcBdiCAlHos2isOp56RnCyfVA?e=TtAXKg) as my starting point.
Information about primatives in d3 was found [here](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/shape.html)
Polygon code debugged with the help of [this stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13204562/proper-format-for-drawing-polygon-data-in-d3).
Code for color transitions adapted from examples on the [d3 transitions repo](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition).

Vis Details
---

For this project you should use d3.js. 
You can learn from examples on the [d3.js](http://d3js.org) site or start from scratch.

See the [Using d3js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki#using) documentation for how to run your own local server.

Creative solutions are welcome! In the past I've seen recreations of paintings, interactives, and more.

Go beyond the minimum requirements of this project.
Experiment with other aspects of the [d3 API](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/API-Reference) and [d3 Tutorials](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Tutorials). 
Try making the elements interactive, for example, or animate them.

Grading
---

Grades are on a 120 point scale. 
96 points will be graded for functionality: the program does what the assignment requests with an informative README. 

We will use Google Chrome to view submissions. 
Be sure to test your code there.

Below are some, but not necessarily all, of the key points we will consider during grading:

- Circles and Rectangles  
- Lines  
- Polygons  
- Different colors  
- README Quality
    - A description of what you have created. 1-2 screenshots are recommended for the README.  
    - A working link to the hosted files (usually the gh-pages 'live' url)  
    - Section for Technical and Design Achievements

Technical Achievement Desription -- 12  
Design Achievement Description -- 12

Remember, it is up to *you* to define what constitutes a technical and design achievements.
Be ambitious as these are designed to allow you to shape your learning.
These are the only way to move from B to A territory.
